# QuickChat
QuickChat is a non-profit experimental chat app created by Topic Duo. It’s designed to connect users randomly for quick, themed conversations, helping people engage and interact in short, fun bursts.

##Web Model Preview
This web version is a preview of the app, featuring an AI-powered chat instead of real users. It demonstrates the app’s interface, timer, and theme system—so you can see how QuickChat will work once it’s fully live.

⚠️ Everything here is still a work in progress. Features may change, and some elements are for demonstration purposes only.

## Features (Preview Version)
- Random conversation themes updated every round.
- Timer showing remaining time for each theme.
- AI chat that simulates real users.
- Memory reset and conversation control (Reset, Quit, Continue).
- Short, fun, casual chat style.
